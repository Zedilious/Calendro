Calendro is a Android Application made for the purpose of increasing the mental intellegence agility of the elderly, through the use of technology. It is a calendar application that interacts with a piece of java software, that fellow group members had created. My role was to ensure the application was created and up to a high standard through my own regard. The application uses drawable bitmaps and MQTT connections to allow this software to interact and store accurate user input.

Calendro is a calendar specfically created through the use of focus groups of particapants from ages 60+ to ensure the final output was satisfactory. This application was submitted to the "RSA Student Design Competition 2017".
